It \\\"seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible.\\\" The index compares the relative price worldwide to purchase the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThe Big Mac index was introduced in The Economist in September 1986 by Pam Woodall as a semi-humorous illustration of PPP and has been published by that paper annually since then. Although the Big Mac Index was not intended to be a legitimate tool for exchange rate evaluation, it is now globally recognised and featured in many academic textbooks and reports. The index also gave rise to the word burgenomics.\\n\\nThe theory underpinning the Big Mac index stems from the concept of PPP, which states that the exchange rate between two currencies should equalize the prices charged for an identical basket of goods. However, in reality, sourcing an identical basket of goods in every country provides a complex challenge. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), over \\\"3,000 consumer goods and services, 30 occupations in government, 200 types of equipment goods and about 15 construction projects\\\" are included in the current PPP calculations. In an effort to simplify this important economic concept. The Economist proposed that a single McDonald's Big Mac could be used instead of a basket of goods. A McDonald's Big Mac was chosen because of the prevalence of the fast food chain worldwide, and because the sandwich remains largely the same across all countries. Although a single sandwich may seem overly simplistic for PPP theory, the price of a Big Mac is derived. from the culmination of \\\"many local economic factors, such as the price of the ingredients, local wages, or how much it costs to put up billboards and buy TV ads\\\". As a result, the Big Mac index provides a \\\"reasonable measure of real-world purchasing power\\\".\\n\\nThe purpose of the Big Mac index is to calculate an implied exchange rate between two currencies. In order to calculate the Big Mac index, the price of a Big Mac in a foreign country (in the foreign country's currency) is divided by the price of a Big Mac in a base country (in the base country's currency). Typically, the base country used is the United States.\\n\\nFor example, using figures from July 2023\\n\\nIn Switzerland, a Big Mac costs 6.70 Swiss franc.\\n\\nIn the US, a Big Mac costs $5.58 USD.\\n\\nThe implied exchange rate is 1.20 SFr/USD, that is 6.70SFr/$5.58USD = 1.20.\\n\\nConsistent with PPP economic theory, the Big Mac index also provides a method to analyse a\\n\\ncurrency's level of under/over-valuation against a base currency. [9] In order to calculate whether\\n\\ncurrency is under/over-valued, the implied exchange rate (as defined by the Big Mac index) must be compared to the actual exchange rate. If the implied exchange rate is greater than the actual exchange rate, then the analysed currency is overvalued against the base currency. If the implied exchange rate is less than the actual exchange rate, then the analysed currency is undervalued against the base currency.\\n\\nFor example, using figures for July 2023:\\n\\nThe implied exchange rate according to the Big Mac index is 1.20 SFr/USD\\n\\nThe actual exchange rate is 0.87 SFr/USD\\n\\nThe Swiss franc is overvalued by 38.5% against the US dollar, that is (1.20-0.87)/0.87 = 38.5% Variants\\n\\nThe Economist sometimes produces variants on the theme. For example, in January 2004, it showed a Tall Latte index with the Big Mac replaced by a cup of Starbucks coffee.\\n\\nIn 2007, an Australian bank tried a variation the Big Mac index, being an \\\"iPod index\\\": since the iPod is manufactured at a single place, the value of iPods should be more consistent globally.
